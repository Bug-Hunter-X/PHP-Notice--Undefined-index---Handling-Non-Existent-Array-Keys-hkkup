This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to undefined array keys.  When accessing an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP will generate a notice, but won't throw an error by default.

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
echo $myArray['c']; //Notice: Undefined index: c
?>
```

This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the undefined value is used in subsequent calculations or operations.  The program might continue to run without crashing, but the results might be incorrect or misleading.
